# GalaxySlicer Profile Library

All printer profiles for the GalaxySlicer are stored in this library. All profiles are managed here and new profiles are added. In addition, the fixes of the profiles are imported into the library.

The library is linked to the Profile Manger of the GalaxySlicer, so that all profiles can be synchronized and are compatible with all GalaxySlicer versions that support the Profile Manger.

**For a version that does not support the Profile Manager, the profiles themselves must be copied to the resource folder of the installation directory and existing profiles must be customized.**

The advantage of synchronization is that local profiles can be updated via the library or new profiles can be integrated into the existing version of the slicer.


>⚠️ The profiles are only compatible with the GalaxySlicer
