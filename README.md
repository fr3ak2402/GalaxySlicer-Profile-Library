>⚠️ The profiles are only compatible with the GalaxySlicer. The management of profiles has changed so that this can only be done via the GalaxySlicer Profile Manager.

All printer profiles for the GalaxySlicer are stored in this library. All profiles are managed here and new profiles are added. In addition, the fixes of the profiles are imported into the library.

The library is linked to the Profile Manger of the GalaxySlicer, so that all profiles can be synchronized and are compatible with all GalaxySlicer versions that support the Profile Manger.

The advantage of synchronization is that local profiles can be updated via the library or new profiles can be integrated into the existing version of the slicer.

For more information on how to create a new profile, see the wiki of this repository.
